# DogAO
## Dog Autonomous Organization


Welcome to the DogAO pup-pound, you's invited to join the fun!
DogAO is a place for pups of any type and is very serious. My dad said we pup's gotta work together to make sure these hoomans don't mess everything up on our planet earth so we gotta use these interweebs! We is pack so we is DAO.
If you are a hooman pretending to be a dog, we smell you. If you somehow has DOG tokens (not to be confused with DOGE which is not very smart like DOG) you has to follow these instructions very carefully to give tokens to your puppers.
By giving these DOG tokens to your pup it will have the right to vote on pack ideas, you can also suggest some if you're in the pack.
Woof,
Ripley
